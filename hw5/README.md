## Usage

1. main.cpp controls DISCO-L475VG-IOT01A (B-L475E-IOT01A) to output a periodic(PWM) signal for Logical Analyzer to read.
2. Logic Analyzer generates a PWM waveform, allowing us to analyze it.

## Result
This is the result from the Logic Analyzer Application. 
- We can observe that the period is a 50% duty cycle, relative to period
